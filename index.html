        <p>Marceline Abadeer (full title: Marceline the Vampire Queen) is one of the main characters in <em><a href="https://adventuretime.fandom.com/wiki/Adventure_Time_Wiki">Adventure Time</a></em> and the main protagonist of the miniseries Stakes.</p>
        <p>Marceline is a fun-loving and playful 1,000-year-old vampire queen. Unlike a traditional vampire, Marceline does not need to drink blood to survive; rather, she consumes the color red, or other similar tints. Marceline is also an avid musician who plays an electric bass guitar, which she crafted from her family's heirloom battle-axe. As of "Come Along With Me", Marceline and Princess Bubblegum have resumed their romantic relationship and is currently Bonnibel's girlfriend again.</p>
